                  To design hinge with auto-close and free stop function which is mounted in oven door, analyzing torque on hinge is an essential process. Using a computational simulation software for dynamic analysis takes complicated manipulation
                  process.
                  Hence, it cannot provide reverse engineering, which modifies hinge property(cam profile) through setting desirable torque profile. Therefore, I analyzed structural property of hinge to simplify torque analysis and deployed it on
                  the
                  web platform to make an interactive design with graphical modification possible.<br>

                  </div>
                  &nbsp I chose web because of universality and scalability. Any user can use this platform only with internet browser and future additional function can be easily adapted. With mechanical analysis result, I made several function in d3.js
                  which is a library that enables data plot and manipulation. As a result, user can get torque profile directly only with dragging cam profile and vice versa without heavy simulation.
                  <div class="row">

                  </div>
                  &nbsp With prototype version of Interactive Torque Designer, I asked feedback to field engineers who design hinge. After getting several user experience feedbacks, I added multiple drag and other functions to make design process
                  more easily. With the final version of Interactive Torque Designer, user can intuitively analyze torque and do the inverse engineering, which significantly simplifies mechanical design process of mass produced hinge. Furthermore, it helps engineer to communicate with other division member, since it explains physical phenomenon through intuitive expression without abstract knowledge.
